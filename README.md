# How to Use this Code!

1. One of the ways is to directly download the files in zip format.

2. Else if you have git installed, copy the link given in the code section and run the following command

    git clone <link>

Hence, you will recieve the files in your local system directory.



# Function used and its usabilities

1. onload function: a) It is used to get the input from the user by clicking on the numericals and other buttons.
                    b) It is made up of switch cases consisting of
relevant button names for ex. one, sqrt for square root etc.                    

2. number function: a) Its key function is to take the input which is clicked by the user and display it on the screen accordingly.
                    b) If the input is any alphabet or any other
irrelevant button, the display is set to zero again.

3. pi function: a) This function computes the value of pi using Math.PI function and displays accordingly.

4. e function: a) It is called exponential function where value of e stands to be 2.81. Similar to pi function, the value of e is found by using Math.e and used accordingly.

5. sin, cos, tan functions: a) These are one variable operations taking a single input in terms of angle. 

6. log and ln function: a) The log and ln functions slightly differ as log used as log base 10 and ln as base e.
                        b) To solve this issue, I have used the 
simple mathematical logic of dividing log calculated with Math.log to Math.LN10

7. power2, exp, base10 functions: a) This function uses Math.pow function to calculate the powers accordingly.

8. fraction function: a) For fraction function, I have just used the simple term "Type Coercion".
